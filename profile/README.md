Is ‘Venom 3: The Last Dance’ Strea𝚖ing?

No, Venom 3: The Last Dance is not yet available to Strea𝚖. Venom 3: The Last Dance will eventually be available to Strea𝚖 on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Venom 3: The Last Dance arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on december 30, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the Mo𝚟ie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the Strea𝚖ing platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘Venom 3: The Last Dance’ In Theaters?

Absolutely! Audiences can catch Venom 3: The Last Dance in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first Mo𝚟ie.

Venom 3: The Last Dance Is Bad on Purpose - Venom 3: The Last Dance begins the way so many promising m𝚘v𝚒es do: with the villain explaining what his deal is in an opening monologue that was clearly added in because either test audiences or studio executives found him too confusing. The thing is it’s no less confusing for being laid out in flat terms over a montage of Frank Frazetta–y imagery of a savage fantasy wilderness. The villain, Knull (Andy Serkis), is a godlike figure who apparently predates the universe; he created and then was betrayed and imprisoned by the race of alien symbiotes that Venom belongs to. In the m𝚘v𝚒e, he manifests as a mass of dirty-blond hair hunched in the middle of a swamp. As Venom 3: The Last Dance progresses and it becomes clear that Knull is just going to remain in that swamp and dispatch portal-hopping spider-lizard-monster things to do his bidding, you might start to get that sinking feeling that accompanies so many late-period superhero m𝚘v𝚒es, when you realize that half of the shit happening onscreen is in service to some future installment that may or may not ever arrive. Venom 3: The Last Dance is supposed to be the end of a trilogy — it’s right there in the title — and yet it floats some future big bad seemingly out of habit, like the need to never resolve things is a feature and not a bug of these m𝚘v𝚒es, a promise that next time, things will actually get good.

Have any of the Venoms been good? The first one was essentially a Madame Web–quality enterprise held together by Tom Hardy’s decision to play his character’s transformation from investigative journalist to carnivorous vigilante as a one-man buddy comedy. The subsequent follow-ups have had the misfortune of being in on that joke and leaning into it with increasingly goofy bits like Venom cooking breakfast (which happens in Venom: Let There Be Carnage) and Venom dancing to ABBA (as he does in Venom 3: The Last Dance, which finds screenwriter Kelly Marcel stepping up to directing duties). Hardy has remained compelling throughout and spends most of this new m𝚘v𝚒e hung-over in cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, getting yanked from location to location while looking like he’s about to hurl — a comic-book hero who never gets to look cool. But Hardy is one of the great leading weirdos of our era, and the fact that he has spent years now making these half-hearted affairs remotely watchable doesn’t actually feel like much of an accomplishment. Three features is a lot to hang on Hardy doing a digitally enhanced version of a hand-puppet act. There’s a certain point at which you have to wonder if, instead of applauding his ability to sneak a subversively odd performance into a franchise product, he and everyone else involved wouldn’t be better served just making a m𝚘v𝚒e that’s daring to begin with.

Venom 3: The Last Dance is, as much as it’s anything, a road-trip m𝚘v𝚒e that begins with Hardy’s Eddie Brock on the run in Mexico. He attempts to head to New York and instead ends up in the Nevada desert, where scientist Dr. Teddy Payne (Juno Temple) and General Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are running Imperium, an underground program for the study of symbiotes next to the soon-to-be-decommissioned site of Area 51. This is less a journey than a plot convergence. While Strickland and his special-ops forces have been tracking Eddie in their efforts to gather symbiotes, Eddie and Venom have also attracted the attention of one of Knull’s henchmonsters for reasons that even the characters within the m𝚘v𝚒e have trouble explaining. Basically, the Eddie-Venom combination is key to Knull’s freedom, though the henchmonsters, which are called Xenophages, can home in on the duo only when they’re in full black, toothy form. This is regrettable because Venom only really looks good that way, though the effects are in general a little less janky in this installment than the previous two. Instead, we get a lot of Venom as a floating head coming out of Eddie’s back, as well as Horse Venom, Fish Venom, and Frog Venom, as the pair try to evade capture by Imperium and by the Xenophages, which can leap thousands of feet, can’t be killed by traditional means, and have a mouth that operates as a wood chipper for flesh.
